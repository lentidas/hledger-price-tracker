# hledger-price-tracker

CLI program to generate market price records for [hledger](https://hledger.org/), using the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) and written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

> [!NOTE]
> This is my first Go project. Despite my best efforts, the code may not follow best practices, but I'm open to suggestions and improvements.
> 
> Also note that maybe some of it might be specific to how I use hledger, how I set my commodities, and so on.
